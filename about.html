							The Cavalier Symphony Orchestra was founded in 2015 by Jocelyn Huang.  The idea began back in high school while she was searching, with no fruition, for a casual means to continue playing in college.  Today, CSO provides a home to 103+ active musicians and fills the  musical niche at the University of Virginia, while strengthening the arts community.
