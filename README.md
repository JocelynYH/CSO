# CSO
The Cavalier Symphony Orchestra website

##What type of users are we dealing with here?
1. Parents with students not in CSO - how do we get them to push their children to join CSO?
2. Parents with students in CSO - how do we get them to support us?
3. Students who don't know much about CSO - how do we hook these people quickly?
4. Students who are looking to join - how do we serve these users smoothly?
5. Students who are already members - how do we make this website quick for them to use?

##What do we want from each of the users?
1. Be interested enough to mention it to their children
2. Come out to concerts and/or support us financially
3. Get them interested and have them join CSO
4. Get them to join CSO
5. Use the website for checking rehearsal info, concert info, music, etc.

##How do we get each user group to do what we want?
1. Hook them with an interesting about page
2. Concert details up and conspicuous
   An email list reminder signup
   Easy donation link (with tax return form if necessary)
3. Hook them with an enticing join page
4. Make the join page easy to navigate
5. Make the members page a simple dashboard rather than a dive-in webpage tree

##What pages do we need for each user group?
1. About
2. Concerts
   Support
3. Join
4. Join
5. Members

##What should the structure of the website be then?
Main tabs: Home, About, Concerts, Support, Join, Members
Home: links to Concerts, Join, Members
About: links to Join (need to get interested students off the about page and into the join page), Concerts, Support
Concerts: Support, Join
Support: About, Concerts
Join: About, Concerts, Members
Members: Concerts, Support, Join

##How is this a change from the current design?
It removes the Media tab and adds the Concerts tab. We have two main audiences for photos and videos: parents and students. We can send parents a post-concert email with a few select pictures and videos. Students will more likely seek media on Facebook. Photos can be displayed on the front page slideshow or placed in select places throughout the website.
